\subsection{Scope of the project}
The goal of this projects is to develop further an existing model by SUBPRO and as the existing model is still under development. Different aspects will be implemented to the process, such as pressure drop, designing the plant such that the resulting \ce{CO2} purge stream is within the regulations for \ce{CO2} storage and adding more accurate oxygen combustion reactions in the reactor. The model will not take the physics and the complexity behind the transport and storage of \ce{CO2}, and will only focusing on improving the model without not considering what is happening with the product outflow.

The model will be optimized for each implementation made with a simple objective function and the resulting variables will be observed and studied for each optimization. In the project, theory around the process and optimization will be presented, and how the system and the model is built. Lastly, the results will be presented and discussed before concluding the project.
